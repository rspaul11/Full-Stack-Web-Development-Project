				We know hiring processes can seem overwhelming, but Google take care that not anyone should feel 
				overwhelmed at Google. Google want all candidates from entry level to leadership, to have access to 
				the same information and resources. Googlers care deeply about their teams and the people who make them up. 
				Google also care about building a more representative and inclusive workplace, and that begins with hiring. 
				In order to truly <span class="span-slogan">build for everyone</span>, they know that we need a 
				diversity of perspectives and experiences, and a fair hiring process is the first step in getting there. 
				With that in mind, Google have broken down the process both visually and verbally as below
