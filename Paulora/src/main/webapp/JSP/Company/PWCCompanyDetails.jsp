				<h5>
					Working with pwc, you will have unique access to global knowledge networks and the opportunity to learn from highly skilled professionals
					<br>

					Shedding a light on the recruitment process. PWC selection process consists of a number of stages through which PWC come to understand your experience and motivation.<br><br>

					Details on the stages are below, but they can vary from country to country. Familiarise yourself with all of them and after you have applied, a manager will confirm what your next steps are!<br>
				</h5>
				<dl>
					<dt>1. Application</dt>
					<dd>Your journey starts with the application. When you apply for a job on our webpage, you will be asked to create an account to our personal system Workday. In your Workday account you can check the progress of our application during the recruitment process.</dd>
				
					<dt>2. Game-based assessment</dt>
					<dd>Once your application is accepted by a recruiter, you will get an email invitation to a quick and enjoyable set of games. You will be asked to undertake a series of short challenges, which are designed to measure several different skills and abilities in an interactive and stimulating way. Those should take you no more than 15 minutes.</dd>

					<dt>3. Video interview</dt>
					<dd>This is a unique opportunity to bring your application to life and to stand out from the rest. A video interview shows who you are much better than a paper cover letter attached to your CV.</dd>

					<dt>4. Assessment Center</dt>
					<dd>The assessment center is a full-day event consisting of two to three stages, such as group exercises, interviews and exams.
					This may sound like a lot, but it is a great opportunity for you to show off a range of skills and how motivated you are.  It is also a chance to meet potential future colleagues and to learn more about PwC and our corporate culture..</dd>

					<dt>5. Interview with manager and/or partner</dt>
					<dd>The one-on-one interview provides you with an opportunity to display your best qualities. PWC are looking for evidence of your skills, experience and abilities. They also want to see that you have carefully considered your career choice. You should be able to demonstrate your clear interest in the business world and PwC, and that you have what it takes to be a "PwC Professional".</dd>

					<dt>6. Offer and pre-hire portal</dt>
					<dd>If you are offered a position with PwC and you accept it, you will be invited to join the portal Look Inside for new joiners to learn more about the firm's corporate culture, what your first days and months will look like and how to connect with PWC and other new joiners. You can also initiate this by connecting with your recruiter.</dd>

					<dt>7. Start date</dt>
					<dd>You will receive practical information about your first day from your recruiter or any other PwC representative in your country. You will be most probably asked to do some preparations before your start date such as providing some personal information or/and documents. Please check your email and follow the instructions. First working day you will receive all the equipment needed and do not worry - you will not be alone in this as we have a buddy system so you will be assigned with somebody who will help you with all necessary things. Good luck!</dd>
