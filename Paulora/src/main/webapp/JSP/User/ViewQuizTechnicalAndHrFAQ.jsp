	            	This is one of the most frequently asked questions during an HR round interview.Your answer has to be short, crisp and to the point. Here are some possible high-impact answers to help you leave a great impression.<br><br>
	            	Example: <br>
	            	"Well, I am a confident, hard-working and a very professional individual. I have also been a good mentor to my juniors and never hesitate to guide them. On the other hand, I am a creative person and I love to test my boundaries."

	            	"I work too hard sometimes and care too much about my work. I take my tasks back home and work even during the weekends. You can call me a workaholic, but my family always points out that this is not right. Slowly and steadily I am realizing that speed and working smartly are the key. So, I have begun to reach out to my colleagues for ready-to-use workarounds so that I can give more time to my family."

For a fresher, I have the right amount of exposure into this industry, as I have completed my internship with XYZ company only recently."

						Why Did You Choose a Career in Software Development?

	          <div class="text-component">
	      	<!-- Answer Here -->
	            <p>
	            	I've always had a knack for solving problems and I feel that software does just that. I chose a career in software development because I find satisfaction in helping consumers, companies, and organizations find the solutions they need, from creating spreadsheets to designing skyscrapers. Additionally, I have experience with a variety of programming languages and enjoy working with them. For example, while I was in college, I helped a relative build a business website and web app. I also built human resources software at my prior job.

	          <div class="text-component">
	      	<!-- Answer Here -->
	            <p>
	            	I first learned how to use JavaScript, CSS, and HTML in college. Those were the languages I used the most when I helped a relative build a business site and web app. But as part of that project, I started learning how to use Python and PHP. In addition, I used C++ and Java to create HR software at my previous job. I found the C++ language to be the most flexible. In fact, it was the primary building block for the HR software I helped develop.

						Can You Describe the Steps Involved in Software Development?

	          <div class="text-component">
	      	<!-- Answer Here -->
	            <p>
	            	Initial planning and brainstorming is the first step in software development. During this stage, I determine the purpose and functionality of a program. The next step involves team analysis of the project, including the time frame and which tools and team members are needed. Then comes the design stage, where a program is designed by a team of software engineers before moving on to the development stage. Once in development, I step in to transform the design into functional software. It's then shipped off to quality assurance to identify any defects or bugs. Lastly, the software is officially installed and launched.

	      	<!-- Answer Here -->
	            <p>
	            	I usually launch code-based testing to identify and diagnose potential errors. When I helped test the HR software, I asked another member of the team peer review my code. They found one logical error that resulted in incorrect output. Once the coding error was corrected, I used Dynamic Testing to evaluate the software for functionality. By then, it appeared to work as projected.

It is also known as Code-Based testing or Structural testing. Different types of white box testing are
	            	<br> 1. Statement Coverage

Validation is the process of evaluating software at the after the development process and to check whether it meets the customer requirements.

	            	Financial Accounting - This branch of accounting records, summarises and reports the business transactions that take place over a time period in an organisation. It is required in both the private and public sectors. 
					<br><br>
					Administrative Accounting - Administrative accounting is focused on the administrative aspects of the company and is used above all to assess the fulfilment of the established objectives and improve the implemented strategy. It is very useful for making forecasts and planning the actions and resources to be used.
					<br><br>
					Tax Accounting -Tax accounting helps to register and prepare reports related to tax returns to the public treasury and payment of taxes.
					<br><br>
					Cost Accounting - This type of accounting is more focused on companies of an industrial nature. It helps to make a detailed analysis of the unit costs of production, sales, and, in general, of the production process that the company carries out.
					<br><br>
					Management Accounting - Management accounting has a broader vision than cost accounting since it records all the economic and financial information of the company to be able to make short-term and long-term decisions.

	            <p>
	            	On the balance sheet, the asset account of inventory is reduced by the amount of the write-down, and so is shareholders' equity. The income statement is hit with an expense in either COGS or a separate line item for the amount of the write-down, reducing net income.  On the cash flow statement, the write-down is added back to CFO as it's a non-cash expense but must not be double-counted in the changes of non-cash working capital.

	            	"I have experience using in my personal life and have also set up my professional profile online. I also have experience with social media advertising and its functionality."
					<br><br>
					A good follow-up question you can ask is: "Are there any other social media platforms your company is using?" This can be a great way to get the interviewer engaged in a discussion about how the company uses social media.
